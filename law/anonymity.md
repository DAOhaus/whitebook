  Why be anonymous? or psuedo anonymous? because it's more powerful, removes
  vanity and allows purpose over leader charisma to be driving force behind it's
  adoption.

# anon

People can fool others into all sorts of unimaginable things by influencing and creating "stories", "opinions" and "lifestyle" choices that could leave a protocol vulnerable depending on the conditions and level of decentralization on earth at the time of reading.  This protocol is designed to add clarity to industries that thrive off dis-information, hence being as "personally untargetable" or "discreditable" while still providing value is really quite appealing, especially after seeing how BTC has been playing out and how difficult TRUE anon status is in times when a surveillance and police state has the ability to confiscate personal property and restrict personal freedoms at will.
