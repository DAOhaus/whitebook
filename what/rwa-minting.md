# RWA MINTING

With this tool, users will select which attributes they want to mint a token with. Our ecosystem's workflow mints an NFT to be used in conjunction with its fractional token of which a percentage is staked and based in underlying LÂ£GT.

However, it should be able to exist on it's own as an open tool that provides multiple choices to fit variable use cases and gives options such as:

* Base Token Standard (20, 721, 1155)
* Name, Acronym, Supply, Original Token Holders
* Admin enabled or not (20, 721, 1155, MOL)
* Chain for deployment
* DAO enabled or not (20)
* Distribution enabled or not (20 / 1155)
* Documents to be attached or other files it represents (721 / 1155)
* AMM enabled or not (20 / 1155)

This tool alone will fuel what is needed in order to denote a real world asset via token.  There are two workflows for how this would operate depending on needs and requirements for the token:

### **Non-Fungible Tokens: NFT**

Because Operating Agreements are typically private documents, the only information that you need to attach to the NFT is an image or PDF of the title along with any other documents deemed appropriate for the asset in question.\
\
Metadata would be editable by owner, or point to location that is editable by DAO or other entity.  In the same way NFTs are being used to represent digital art, we would use the standard to point directly to a title or other proof of ownership and value creating a 1:1 bond with the ability to sell.  \
\
I foresee this token being used allow entry to the property, used as collateral in DeFi applications or as just a more efficient manner to perform future sales of the underlying asset.

### **Fungible DAO Governance Tokens: ERC20DAO**

The underlying blockchain exists as a link for the documents used by the group and the address performing the mint.  At the end of the day, all that really matters is that the token holders can verify the authenticity of their token and that it hold up in a court of law.

How this can look is by listing the public address in either the original documents, or if pre-existing documents are being used a notarized document linking the address that minted to an identity of an authorized agent of the Legal Entity.  These documents should be hosted somewhere that when inquired about by a token holder can be demonstrated in order to prove token asset link.

While holding the title in NFT is not absolutely necessary, our thesis is that it will be used as the digital representation of the title for lending and other defi protocols in the future and as such might as well mint the token sooner rather than later.  It also has the added benefit of saving on closing costs for a potential future sale.

This legal token bridge is important because physical assets exist in physical jurisdictions and each jurisdiction can hypothetically handle property rights in different ways.&#x20;

Included are the rights and privileges chosen at time of mint such as the power given to an admin the ability to enact changes to the token as dictated by votes in the DAO, court rulings in their jurisdiction or cataclysmic events such as deaths or underlying blockchain outages.

Additional services such as a voting platforms will be built and in the meantime tools such as snapshot can or other off-chain solutions can act in its place.

While a flat fee can be provided in order to use the standard minter, other functionality such as DAO creation, legal ties and providing AMM services require that the token give up a percentage of its underlying asset to the collective LEGT DAO.

Doing this process alone can increase the value of your asset intrinsically.  Just minting a token that represents ownership in an LLC and then adding it to a platform such as uniswap is one way to revaluate your asset above what the normal appraisal process would traditionally assign it.  You can then use that token to pay for goods and services rather than taking out a home equity line of credit, which costs thousands of dollars and requires you to make monthly payments towards. &#x20;

The LEGT DAO will be the first of its kind as an admin enabled ERC20 DAO token.  For already existing tokens there will be a bridge or wrapper created to allow for interoperability with legacy tokens without having to re-mint.
