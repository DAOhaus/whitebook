# ERC20DAO LENDING

For sake of example we will use an ERC20DAO token that is representative of the governance and revenue of an AirBnB. The manager wants to borrow the maximum amount possible against a property currently valued at $200,000 via traditional appraisal and has $30,000 in yearly revenue.

The DAO recognizes unrealized value in the property, with a $300,000 valuation at a 10% cap rate so is desirous to take on the property. It mints 100 property tokens (BNBT) and decides on a the following economics. While the values are variable in nature, a healthy token should remain distinctly decentralized in ownership, with the principal remaining in the hands of the BANK SAFE DAO if/until a 3/4 majority decides.

* 20% adjustable market valuation buffer - $160,000
* 20% AMM position using USDC / BNBT pair  - 10 / $32,000
* 31% BANK SAFE STAKE minimum - $49,600

an amount of considerable amount is needed in order to protect the DAOs entitlement incase of a Revenue Drop to Trigger for AMM Liquidity, for example revenues dropping 20% or $21,000/yr in operating losses.

The asset will be collateralized at a secure liquidation price of $160,000 in order to account for pricing risks during a real world liquidation event.

The AirBnB manager now holds 80% of the asset, which at its new valuation is worth $224,000 according to the liquidity locked in the AMM.  That's a 10% increase literally happening overnight to capture the unrecognized value upon tokenization, like unto a public market offering.

If the manager desires to stake these tokens to mint LEGT they may do so, however in order to offset the risk of defaulting on revenue deposit responsibilities -- such as in a "take the money and run" attack -- there is an imposed minimum where the total locked in the the AMM and the amount the DAO holds must equal above 50% of the BNBT.  That way the DAO can regain control and either appoint a new manager or sell the underlying asset but only if the revenue produced by the asset falls below the before agreed upon amount.

Since 20% is already allocated to the pool, the minimum amount in order to mint LEGT stable coin is 31% and equates to $49,600 with a maximum of $128,000 LEGT for all 80.  If foul play occurs the DAO closes the AMM and regains control of the underlying asset in order to either recoup loss or appoint a new manager.

This principal also works in today's financial ecosystem, but in a kind of upside down way by reserving value for IPO pre-buyers and rewarding financially the venture capital market.  We can see this dynamic at play with this [bit of unconventional wisdom](https://medium.com/swlh/a-successful-ipo-means-your-stock-price-goes-down-fd3c1aa53f00).
