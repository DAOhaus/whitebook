# What

In the same way that a man can be both a brother and a baker, our tools and services can stand alone to service a particular user need, as well as be integrated into a collective ecosystem with each other. &#x20;

For example, while we plan on minting our own NFTs we can also use NFTs that have been minted on other platforms - taking advantage of the beautiful modularity and accessibility built into many blockchain systems. &#x20;

At the core of this ecosystem is an emerging token standard that creates an admin enabled DAO token in order to:

* Allow an admin to be selected, transferred and removed
* Allow admin to adjust internal variables, metadata for NFTs owned, and transfer tokens held
* Act as escrow that gives rights of withdrawal to accounts according to their token percentage&#x20;
* Enforce an exit tax for individual transfers but not collectively determined ones
* ERC20 compliant so as to work with tools like Uniswap and Snapshot
* Own and transfer tokens

I believe these to be the features required to create a baseline DAO token.  There are many DAO models and experiments going on the space and as such I expect there to be additions made along the way allowing an end user to pick and choose functionality they wish to bake into the token upon creation.

When the admin in such a token is paired with a lawyer or otherwise obligated third party such as the executor of a trust, this creates the foundation used for **Legally Enforceable Governance Tokens.**
