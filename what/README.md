# what

In the same way that a man can be both a brother and a baker, our tools and services can stand alone to service a particular user need, as well as be integrated into a collective ecosystem with each other. &#x20;

For example, while we plan on minting our own NFTs we can also use NFTs that have been minted on other platforms - taking advantage of the beautiful modularity and accessibility built into many blockchain systems. &#x20;

At the core of this ecosystem is an emerging token standard 1776 that creates an admin enabled DAO token, enabling endless possibilities along the lines of:

* Allow an admin to be selected, transferred and removed
* Allow admin to adjust internal variables, metadata for NFTs owned, and transfer tokens held
* Act as escrow that gives rights of withdrawal to accounts according to their token percentage&#x20;
* Enforce an exit tax for individual transfers but not collectively determined ones
* ERC20 compliant so as to work with tools like Uniswap and Snapshot
* Own and transfer tokens
* etc...

I believe these to be the features required to create a baseline DAO token and plan to create an EIP in order to create its own token standard, if one does not already exist that provides these needed functionalities. &#x20;

Eventually we will integrate all sorts of models and DAO frameworks for minter to choose from on creation depending on their needs.  There are many DAO experiments going on in the space and as such I expect there to be additions, alterations and pivots made along the way.

When a token is paired with a lawyer or otherwise obligated third party such as the executor of a trust, this creates the foundation used for the base to all **Legally Empowered Governance Tokens** minted  ðŸ–¨  &#x20;
