# L£GT ĐAO

It is suggested that assets meet the following criteria to be eligible for funding via the protocol in U$D - be they NFT, DAO or DEBT:

* having a reliable appraisal value&#x20;
* connected to a trusted 3rd party as administrator
* revenue or interest bearing

Its tokens can now be used in LEGIQUITY - our asset backed lending protocol.  As such each token minted is technically a LEGT enabled token, and this is simply a way to borrow USD value by collateralizing these types of tokens. &#x20;

Whereas the tokens minted on "store of value" assets that don't generate revenue, say in a primary residence, the revenue is replaced with a traditional payment plan similar to a mortgage.

Our thesis revolves around the idea that many properties are not correctly priced in accordance to their revenue because the comparibles used in traditional lending are denoted in residential housing sale prices, not as a reflection of it as an operating business operating the investment property.  This essentially is leaving value on the table that our DAO can help make accessible to the owner in exchange for a portion of their underlying asset and business. As such it is an asset backed and revenue generating token.&#x20;

### Responsibilities

The LEGT DAO is responsible for these fundamental things:&#x20;

* Approving deals to come into its ecosystem by assessing the risk of forecasted revenue and costs associated with liquidations
* Find, onboard, manage and liquidate when necessary the assets in its ecosystem
* Maintain the LEGT / USDC pool
* Grow the ecosystem of tools and protocols that interface with the protocol
