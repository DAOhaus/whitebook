# NFT LENDING

If the asset is not revenue producing, the LEGT side of the AMM pool would need to place the NFT in escrow with a service fee and interest rates, replacing what today is referred to as a down payment or "points" by traditional institutions. &#x20;

The DAO would agree on the rate at which was needed for the loan, and in doing so would be honoring the provided store of value amount for given item - and has the power to sell the item in the event that the underlying asset drops to a predetermined liquidation level.

This can be setup so that when the oracle value drops, it goes to vote but isn't necessarily doomed to be liquidated in accordance to outlook and preference of token holders.

Basically this is very similar to the products being created today in the sense that an over-collateralized amount is agreed upon and then if it crosses that amount - liquidators are incentivized to sell it and ensure the principal of the loan is covered.

NFTs intrinsically need to be used in this system as it only works to sell the entire asset. Also the use of reliable oracles is paramount to the success of this path. If oracles are inaccurate there could be both false positives and negatives.  Requiring the DAO vote before immediate liquidation protects against skewed oracle numbers as the system gradually learns and improves.

This style of system is very close to the methodologies behind popular platforms such as Nexo and Celsius and provides a fix for the bank run experienced in the Terra / Luna ecosystem.
