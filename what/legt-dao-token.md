# LEGT DAO TOKEN

Given that a token can reliably be attached to % ownership in a revenue generating asset and meets 3 certain criteria:

* having a reliable appraisal value&#x20;
* connected to a trusted 3rd party as administrator
* revenue generating

Its tokens can now be used in LEGIQUITY - our asset backed lending protocol.  As such each token minted is technically a LEGT-enabled token, and this is simply a way to borrow USD value by collateralizing these types of tokens. &#x20;

Whereas the tokens minted on "store of value" assets that don't generate revenue, say in a primary residence, the revenue is replaced with a traditional payment plan similar to a mortgage.

Our thesis revolves around the idea that many properties are not correctly priced in accordance to their revenue because the comparables used in traditional lending are denoted in residential housing sale prices, not as a reflection of it as an investment property.  This essentially is leaving appreciation on the table that our DAO can help make accessible to the owner in exchange for a portion of their underlying asset and business. As such it is an asset backed and revenue generating token.&#x20;

### An Example

An AirBnB manager wants to borrow the maximum amount possible against a property currently valued at $200,000 and has $30,000 in yearly revenue.

The DAO recognizes unrealized value in the property, with a $300,000 valuation at a 10% cap rate so is desirous to take on the property. It mints 100 property tokens (BNBT) and decides on a the following economics:&#x20;

* 20% market valuation buffer - $160,000
* 20% AMM position using USDC / BNBT pair  - 10 / $32,000
* 31% STAKE minimum - $49,600
* 40% Revenue drop to trigger AMM withdrawal vote - $21,000/yr

The asset will be collateralized at a secure liquidation price of $160,000 in order to account for pricing risks during a real world liquidation event.

The AirBnB manager now holds 80% of the asset, which at its new valuation is worth $224,000 according to the liquidity locked in the AMM.  That's a 10% increase literally happening overnight to capture the unrecognized value.

If the manager desires to stake these tokens to mint LEGT they may do so, however in order to offset the risk of defaulting on revenue deposit responsibilities -- such as in a "take the money and run" attack -- there is an imposed minimum where the total locked in the the AMM and the amount the DAO holds must equal above 50% of the BNBT.  That way the DAO can regain control and either appoint a new manager or sell the underlying asset but only if the revenue produced by the asset falls below the before agreed upon amount.

Since 20% is already allocated to the pool, the minimum amount in order to mint LEGT stable coin is 31% and equates to $49,600 with a maximum of $128,000 LEGT for all 80.  If foul play occurs the DAO closes the AMM and regains control of the underlying asset in order to either recoup loss or appoint a new manager.

### Responsibilities

The LEGT DAO is responsible for these fundamental things:&#x20;

* Approving deals to come into its ecosystem by assessing the risk of forecasted revenue and costs associated with liquidations
* Find, onboard and manage the assets in it's ecosystem, including liquidations
* Maintain the LEGT / USDC pool using the cashflow generated from it's assets
* Grow the ecosystem of tools and protocols that interface with LEGT
