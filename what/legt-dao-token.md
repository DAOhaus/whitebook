  USD value connected with underlying assets and revenue streams

# LEGT ĐAO TOKEN

Assets that meet the following criteria are eligible to be funded via the protocol, be they NFT or ERC20:

* having a reliable appraisal value&#x20;
* connected to a trusted 3rd party as administrator
* revenue generating

Its tokens can now be used in LEGIQUITY - our asset backed lending protocol.  As such each token minted is technically a LEGT enabled token, and this is simply a way to borrow USD value by collateralizing these types of tokens. &#x20;

Whereas the tokens minted on "store of value" assets that don't generate revenue, say in a primary residence, the revenue is replaced with a traditional payment plan similar to a mortgage.

Our thesis revolves around the idea that many properties are not correctly priced in accordance to their revenue because the comparables used in traditional lending are denoted in residential housing sale prices, not as a reflection of it as an investment property.  This essentially is leaving appreciation on the table that our DAO can help make accessible to the owner in exchange for a portion of their underlying asset and business. As such it is an asset backed and revenue generating token.&#x20;

### Responsibilities

The LEGT DAO is responsible for these fundamental things:&#x20;

* Approving deals to come into its ecosystem by assessing the risk of forecasted revenue and costs associated with liquidations
* Find, onboard and manage the assets in it's ecosystem, including liquidations
* Maintain the LEGT / USDC pool using the cashflow generated from it's assets
* Grow the ecosystem of tools and protocols that interface with LEGT
