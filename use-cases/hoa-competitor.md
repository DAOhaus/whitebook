# HOA Competitor

It has recently been brought to my attention that there was an instance with a [Surfside Florida HOA](https://therealdeal.com/miami/2021/06/25/details-emerge-in-search-for-cause-of-fatal-surfside-condo-collapse/), that through failure to effectively maintain their building caused many deaths.  Ideally the tokens and systems outlined in this book will enable communities like this to maintain and fix such problems.
