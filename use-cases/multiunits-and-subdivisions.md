# Multiunits and Subdivisions

These ideas are easily expressed when dealing on a 1:1 basis - for example the title of a single family residence can easily be represented by NFT held by an ERC20DAO - however when a single title represents a large area of land, or a complex series of individual assets and independent DAOs inside of it, this is our suggested token structure:

Title NFT owned by ERC20DAO for entire property\
Each smallest divisible unit, or cubit, be put into an NFT\
Each on-sight company or service be denoted in ERC20DAO

If platforms such as Snapshot and Uniswap started to support 1155 it would make sense to just put the entire project into that one standard as it allows for both ERC20 and 721 standards to co-exist on the same contract just so long as the products one desires to integrate with support them.
