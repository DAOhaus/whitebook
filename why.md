# Why

### **Short Version**

Think of our DAO tokens as an LLC/HOA/CORP upgrade that when paired with an asset will increases its overall value. Your house is worth $100k now, allow it to be represented via a NFT held by a DAO token and watch it become $120k, along with the added bonus of not having to pay thousands each time you want to borrow against your underlying equity.

### **Long Version**

Thanks to new paradigms and frameworks that we will introduce with our ecosystem and that exist today via Defi, these DAO tokens will add benefits in the areas of **liquidity**, **financing**, **adaptability** and overall make the equity in your asset more **nimble** and **efficient** to allow for small and frequent transfers that used to cost thousands of dollars to perform.

While these new solutions may not be perfect, it is our thesis that it will usher in a new era of collaborative asset ownership that allows for new levels of economic abundance and higher levels of satisfaction across employees, shareholders and consumers alike.

#### **Liquidity**

Currently if a member of a general partner wants to exit their position they must find a new buyer and get approval of the other partners and amend the operating agreement. Automated Market Making and bonded curves have recently been utilized to give token based projects liquidity to solve for this.  It is part of our thesis that this mechanism will give the underlying assets an added Liquidity Premium to inherently increase its value**.**

**Nimble & Efficient**

In our current system obtaining a line of credit is a operation that costs anywhere from [$2,000 to $20,000](https://www.rocketmortgage.com/learn/closing-costs). Each time you wish to withdraw money you must do a large enough amount to make the closing costs worth it.  In our ecosystem after you've allowed it to be represented via token, you will be able to pull out any value and it will always be equivalent to the gas cost on Ethereum associated with such a transfer. &#x20;

Same principal applies to transferring ownership when a partner in a LLC desires to exit their position. Now instead of re-notarizing or possibly invoking lawyer fees to refile an operating agreement with adjusted equity positions -- members are simply transferred tokens, which saves on paperwork & costs making your asset more financially efficient to work with.&#x20;

**Finance**

Existing loans that are backed purely by assets aren't commonly geared towards or accessible **** to the common layman. Our ecosystem will mimic other platforms that allow you to finance a loan using your collateralized crypto asset to solve for this.  Also, if the house being tokenized is generating revenue, such as on Airbnb, the **actual value could well be above** that which it is traditionally appraised and assigned when viewed as a typical residential unit.

#### **Adaptability**

The DAO's mission statement, internal policies or metrics for success are able to be viewed and changed by token holders themselves.  Traditional companies often don’t have a mechanism built in for this and so find it difficult to adapt to the views or needs of changing times which can lead to strikes, boycotts or a general culture of “why even bother” that permeates the corporate realm.
