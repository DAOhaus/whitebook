# üëãüèº  White Book Intro

First of all, thank you. This project has been years in the making and I'm excited to finally detail the ecosystem for **minting, managing** and **** offering **liquidity** for DAO **** tokens based in real world assets**.**&#x20;

While real estate tokens have existed for years, you will see that this ecosystem really is just a doorway and catalyst for many assets to be used in other products and services that will benefit greatly from being re-evaluated using custom fitted valuation models.  This will open a new wave of finance for material goods that are represented via blockchain tokens.

In order to understand the following documents it is encouraged that you have a rudimentary understanding of the ideas behind [Blockchain](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/plp-what-is-a-blockchain), [DAOs](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/), Token Standards such as [ERC20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) & [ERC721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) and how they apply to [Real World Assets](https://medium.com/centrifuge/real-world-assets-a-key-building-block-for-the-future-of-defi-cc9157cb6a6a) (RWA), [Liquidity Pools](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-liquidity-pools-in-defi) and collective governance models found in [Intentional Communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional\_community) of all sorts around the world.

Our ecosystem has 3 principal branches that will encompass the tooling and systems we intend to build and utilize.

### The 3 Branches

1. **MINTING**: A token standard that ties legal documents to NFTs which can be owned by admin enabled ERC20 DAO tokens.
2. **MANAGING**: A DAO UI for both external and internal use in running the liquidity protocol and stable coin AMM pools for those tokens to be used in collateral backed lending.
3. **FINANCING**: Perpetual spreading of this ideology with real world assets, NFTs and niche applications that span literally all LLC, HOA or CORP based structures.

Names have a funny way of changing as products become more defined and as the needs of our defi ecosystem change, but as of right now this encapsulates the efforts behind fundamental pillars of the DAOhaus ecosystem: **L**egally **E**mpowered **G**overnance **T**oken minting, the **LEGT** stable token, and the **LEGIQUITY** financial protocol. \

This document is intended to house the intellectual property, product & technical documentation along with philosophical reasonings.  \

That being said it is a work in progress, contributors welcome of course. Let's change the world friend ü•≥ üöÄ
