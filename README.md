  based in real world assets

# Intro

\
`We value what exists, but should also value what does not exist; we value the bowl because of its emptiness. - Lao Tzu`\
****

While real estate tokens have existed for years, you will see that this ecosystem really is more focused on the lending protocol against any asset with a trusted 3rd party appraisal and system for liquidation.  \
\
Inherently it is a doorway and catalyst for many other asset classes to be re-evaluated using custom fitted valuation models.  This will open a new wave of finance for material goods that are represented via blockchain tokens.

In order to understand this thesis it is encouraged that you have a rudimentary understanding of the ideas behind [Blockchain](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/plp-what-is-a-blockchain), [DAOs](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/), Token Standards such as [ERC20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) & [ERC721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) & ERC1776 and how they apply to [Real World Assets](https://medium.com/centrifuge/real-world-assets-a-key-building-block-for-the-future-of-defi-cc9157cb6a6a) (RWA), [Liquidity Pools](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-liquidity-pools-in-defi) and collective governance models found in [Intentional Communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional\_community) of all sorts around the world.

Our ecosystem has 3 principal branches that will encompass the tooling and systems we intend to build and utilize.

### The 3 Branches

1. **MINTING**: A token standard that ties legal documents to NFTs which can be owned by admin enabled ERC20 DAO tokens.
2. **MANAGING**: A DAO UI for both external and internal use in running the liquidity protocol and stable coin AMM pools for those tokens to be used in collateral backed lending.
3. **FINANCING**: Perpetual spreading of this ideology with real world assets, NFTs and niche applications that span literally all LLC, HOA or CORP based structures.

Names have a funny way of changing as markets change and products become defined.  Likewise the needs of our defi ecosystem could change, but as of right now this encapsulates the efforts behind fundamental pillars of the LEGT ƒêAO ecosystem: The minting and management of **L**egally **E**mpowered **G**overnance **T**okens, the **LEGT** stable token, and the **LEGIQUITY** lending protocol.\

The initial land and buildings that will serve as the campus, lab and jurisdiction of the DAO will be in Arecibo, Puerto Rico in partnership with DAOhaus Smart City Technology -- https://daohaus.org\

The firstfruits and initial MVP being a DAO responsible for onboarding real world assets into it's network, or which it will offer liquidity and financing for starting with short term rental properties in multiple crypto friendly jurisdictions around the world ‚úàÔ∏è üåè\

Let's tokenize each other's spare rooms and create a more collective, collaborative and friendly jurisdictionally transcendent society üëã&#x20;
