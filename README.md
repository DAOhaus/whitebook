# Intro

`The ultimate use of the house is not in its walls, but in that part where nothing exists. Profit comes from what is there, usefulness from what is not.`\
`- Lao Tzu #11`\
****

While real estate tokens have existed for years, you will see that this ecosystem really is **** valuable not only in what it does, but what it leaves undone, allowing for human and off-chain systems to more efficiently or morally handle the collective needs and obligations of an asset.\
\
Inherently it is a doorway and catalyst for many other asset classes to be re-evaluated using custom fitted valuation models.  This will open a new wave of finance and supply for material goods to be represented via blockchain tokens and integrated into DeFi.

In order to understand this thesis it is encouraged that you have a rudimentary understanding of the ideas behind [Blockchain](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/plp-what-is-a-blockchain), [DAOs](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/), Token Standards such as [ERC20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/), [ERC721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) & my under development proposal that I affectionately & unofficially call [ERC1776](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/4713/files).\
\
These concepts ride on top of, and prepare us for the flood of [Real World Assets](https://medium.com/centrifuge/real-world-assets-a-key-building-block-for-the-future-of-defi-cc9157cb6a6a) (RWA), to be controlled by collective governance models found in [Intentional Communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional\_community) of all sorts around the world and financed via [Liquidity Pools](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-liquidity-pools-in-defi).

The ecosystem has 3 principal branches that will encompass the tooling and systems we intend to build and utilize.

### The 3 Branches

1. **MINTING**: A token standard that ties legal documents to NFTs which can be owned & managed on-chain by owner enabled ERC20DAO tokens.
2. **MANAGING**: A DAO UI for both external and internal use in running the supply, liquidity protocol and stable coin AMM pools for those tokens to be used in collateral backed lending.
3. **FINANCING**: Perpetual spreading of this ideology with ties into fiat currency for financing real world assets. These NFTs and niche applications that span literally all LLC, HOA, DAO or CORP based organizations as a new form of participation and community based ownership and investing.

Names have a funny way of changing as markets evolve and products become defined, but as of right now this encapsulates the efforts behind fundamental pillars of the **LEGT ƒêAO** ecosystem:

The minting and management of individual **L**egally **E**mpowered **G**overnance **T**okens, the **$LEGT** hybrid-stable pegged token, and the **LEGIQUITY** lending protocol.\

Let's tokenize each other's houses, boats, cars & toys to create a more collective & collaborative society that transcends typical ideas surrounding jurisdictions, abundance and society üëã&#x20;
