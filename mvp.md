# MVP

The MVP should serve as the base app for our 4 major anticipated markets and users: Residential, Commercial, Raw Land & Multiunit.  This document is to outline the user story associated with each of them as a requirements list for what the MVP will be able to perform.

### User Alex

codename: Apartment\
desc: One residential livable cubit unit\

Alex has noticed that their home has 3 bedrooms when they only need 1 and wouldn't mind bringing on more long term roommates.  Alex offers to partition each room into an NFT in exchange for a capital infusion in order to build another bathroom in the house, as well as make upgrades to other public spaces.  Units are already complete, all that is required is a notarized operating agreement, price and a willing roommate.&#x20;
