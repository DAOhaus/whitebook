# My History

We have seen an amazing flourishing of projects in the crypto space, and Iâ€™m excited to formalize and revitalize the project I began years ago while immersing myself in the hopeful holacratic crypto rabbit hole startup called ConsenSys back in 2016.

This ecosystem is very much a product of years being entrenched thinking through new patterns that blockchain has made possible to perform via trustless and transparent incentive structures.

After a few months of building [Balanc3](https://medium.com/@balanc3) -- a triple entry accounting system which didn't take off for reasons we can get into later -- I turned my attention to finding a project that would be so fundamental to my interests that I could theoretically work on it for the rest of my life.

My father was a real estate broker for a bank, and as such I had received exposure to that world and even had a few residential investment properties that I personally owned and managed.  I was in the midst of some issues with more complex real estate transactions that involved escrow accounts, construction mishaps and multiple general partners using funds in some "non-prudent" ways so naturally my mind gravitated towards solving the issues I was having myself.

Working as a software developer I quickly found myself thinking through and mapping out how to better manage these relationships.  This lead to me writing my original white paper for my flavor of DAO that would be managing real world assets and DAOhaus was born ðŸ¤— ðŸ¥³

I fully believe the ideas outlined in this thesis will transform and potentially tokenize entire market segments and GDPs. Traditional institutions will be disrupted, and few financial products and patterns inconceivable today will flourish as a result.

Paradigms have shifted, now it's just time to play catchup.&#x20;

I am grateful for projects such as Mattereum, Moloch, Maker and Liquity along with a handful of other DeFi projects for paving the ideological pathway to where we are today.

While many of these ideas can apply to ANY physical item being represented via a DAO Token we will be building and expounding on specifically real estate, which played a key role in deciding to label my efforts under the DAOhaus name and brand.

As I have spent a considerable amount of time learning and experiencing collectives in different ways throughout my life, notably as a member of the LDS church, living in art collectives and visiting projects such as Damanhur and Kalu Yala - I understand there are limitations that no ideology can fix and that collective governance isn't always the best approach. Nevertheless, my faith lies in that the more power that can be distributed, the better for the whole in making it more resilient to incompetence, short-sightedness and greed.&#x20;
