# Context

We have seen an amazing flourishing of projects in the crypto space, excited to formalize and revitalize the project I began years ago in 2016 while immersing myself in the hopeful holacratic crypto rabbit hole startup ConsenSys.

This ecosystem is very much a product of years being entrenched thinking through new patterns that blockchain has made possible to perform via trustless and transparent incentive structures.

After a few months of building [Balanc3](https://medium.com/@balanc3) -- a triple entry accounting system -- I turned my attention to finding a project that would be so fundamental to my interests that I could theoretically work on it for the rest of my life and with that the seed of this thesis was planted  üå±

My father was a real estate broker for a bank, and as such I had received spillover exposure to the commercial investment world and had select residential properties that I owned and managed. \
\
Becoming involved in some more complex real estate transactions that involved escrow accounts, construction mishaps and multiple general partners using funds in some "non-prudent" ways -- my mind gravitated towards solving the issues I was having myself.

As a software developer I quickly found myself thinking through and mapping out how to better manage these relationships.  This lead to me writing my original white paper for my flavor of DAO, which is at the base of the protocol to manage and finance RWAssets.  \

Boom, snap, crackle & pop - DAOhaus is born üí• üê£  ü•≥

I fully believe the ideas outlined in this thesis will transform and potentially tokenize entire market segments and GDPs. Traditional institutions will be disrupted, and few financial products and patterns inconceivable today will flourish as a result.

Paradigms have shifted, now it's just time to play catchup.&#x20;

I am grateful for projects such as Mattereum, Moloch, Maker and later Liquity along with a handful of other DeFi projects for paving the ideological pathway to where we are today.

While many of these ideas can apply to ANY physical item being represented via a DAO Token we will be building and expounding on specifically real estate.

As I have spent a considerable amount of time learning and experiencing collectives in different ways throughout my life - I understand there are limitations that no ideology can fix and that collective governance isn't always the best approach. As a free market politician I believe in  that allows for voluntarism in which differing governance models can be used by different consenting groups, allowing an ecosystem and market for different models to emerge - and this is just the first step in that larger system and can absolutely be used to centralize power and could provide unseen negative outcomes. Nevertheless, my faith lies in that the more power that can be distributed, the better for the whole it becomes. Putting an incentive on collaboration that will naturally weed out and be more resilient to incompetence, short-sightedness and greed.\

This is world changing stuff, can you feel it?&#x20;
