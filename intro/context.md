# Context

We have seen an amazing flourishing of projects in the crypto space, and as such am excited to formalize and revitalize the project I began thinking about years ago in 2016 while immersing myself in Consensys, the hopeful holacratic ethereum backed accelerator startup machine known for chaotic raw offices and untraditional governance practices.

This ecosystem is very much a product of years spent considering and being exposed to new patterns that blockchain has made possible. Exposing both immense opportunities and also apparent shortcomings.

After a few months of building [Balanc3](https://medium.com/@balanc3) -- a triple entry accounting system -- I turned my attention to finding a project that would be so fundamental to my interests that I could theoretically work on it for the rest of my life - and as such the seedling of where we are today was planted üå±\
\
I had a few residential properties myself, and had becoming involved in some more complex real estate transactions that involved escrow accounts, construction mishaps and multiple general partners using funds in some "non-prudent" ways -- my mind gravitated towards solving the issues I was having myself. As a software developer I quickly found myself thinking through and mapping out how to better manage these relationships. \
\
I also reflected back to experiences I had earlier in attempting to launch and manage a campaign to purchase a private island, giving serious thought to how a project such as that would be managed and wrote the technical specifications for how to do it via smart contract which eventually would evolve into the original DAOhaus white paper for my flavor of DAO.

Snap Crackle Pop! DAOhaus was born and LEGT was not far behind as DeFi Summer created new tools and understandings that would allow for some missing ecosystem pieces to come to maturity to allow for financial integration  üí• üê£  ü•≥



### Backwards & Forwards

My father was the in-house broker for a regional US Bank and commercial real estate instructor at organizations such as IREM and CCIM, and as such I naturally received spillover exposure to aspects of the real estate world.  He also was raised the son of a farmer and continued to maintain the agricultural standing of the land we lived on and steward it while he was alive.\
\
Growing up against a rural background of river bottoms and open fields, I became involved with the scouting program and developed a proper respect and reverence for our amazing earth and the many systems and inhabitants thereof that create the delicate and beautiful balance of this world. I hold real estate not only as an economic commodity to be bought and sold, but as a powerful -- dare I say even spiritual -- force as our home among the stars in this complex and mystifying universe  ‚ú®üöÄ üåå

As I have spent a considerable amount of time learning and experiencing collectives in different ways throughout my life - I understand there are limitations that no ideology can fix and that collective governance isn't always the best approach. \
\
I also support this on a political level as a free market politician that allows for voluntarism in which differing governance models can be used by different consenting groups allowing an ecosystem and market for different models to emerge.  Undoubtedly we will see that there could be unseen and negative outcomes once some of these ideas are put into practice. Nevertheless, my faith lies in that the more power that can be distributed, the better for the whole it becomes. Putting an incentive on collaboration that will naturally weed out and be more resilient against incompetence, short-sightedness and greed.

I fully believe the ideas outlined in this thesis will transform and potentially tokenize entire market segments and GDPs. Traditional institutions will be disrupted, and a few new financial products, services and patterns inconceivable today will flourish as a result.

Paradigms have shifted, now it's just time to play catchup and build tools.

I am grateful for projects such as Mattereum, Moloch, Maker and later Liquity along with a handful of other DeFi projects for paving the ideological pathway to where we are today.
