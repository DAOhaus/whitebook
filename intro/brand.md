**DAO** - Both the acronym [for decentralized autonomous organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized\_autonomous\_organization), and also a spelling for the eastern spiritual path in search for the idealized the way human beings ought to behave in society and with nature.

**HAUS** - German for "house", the word has become a trendy staple in our zeitgeist. Its integration mixes well as our principal concern is with real assets and also holds space as describing an umbrella brand or firm.

When placed together it resembles the Bauhaus art movement that called for a return to fundamental design principles and idealized simplicity and basic form -- similar to our mission for collective management of real world assets.
