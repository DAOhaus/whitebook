# Ecosystem

The L£GT ĐAO is an instance and type of DAO that follows our metastandard for governance of real world assets. ĐAOs of this sort will eventually be mintable and have dashboards at [□△○](https://daohaus.org) that then can be used within this protocol.

## Parent Brand

****\
**DAO** - Both the acronym [for decentralized autonomous organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized\_autonomous\_organization), and also a spelling for the eastern spiritual path in search for the idealized the way human beings ought to behave in society and with nature.

**HAUS** - German - the word has become a trendy staple in our zeitgeist. Its integration mixes well as our principal concern is with real assets and also holds space as describing an umbrella brand or firm.

It is not by accident that it borrows key fundamental shapes used during other fundamentalist movements such as the Bauhaus art movement.  They both share an emphasis for a return to fundamental design principles and idealized simplicity and basic form - we just apply it directly to the collective management of real world assets.\
\
The brand may be boiled down and shortened into the symbols circle square triangle "□∆○" being that they visually spell out D - A - O respectively or D with Stroke "Đ" to act as shorthand for DAO.\
\
Đ is an especially interesting character as it represents such things as the chemistry equivalent of decentralization called "disparity", a global currency, and various other uses that bolster its availability and popularity.
