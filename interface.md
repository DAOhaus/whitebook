# interface

Technically the MVP will be built to anticipate its use across 2 major lending groups: those with revenue generating assets and those that act as a store of value.  This document is to outline the user story associated with each of them as a requirements list for what the MVP will be able to perform in each respective vertical.



## Revenue Generating

An asset such as an Airbnb is generating 10,000 a month.  The owners would like to refinance their property and business in order to afford a down payment on another property\

## Store of Value

An asset such as someone's residence is completely paid off.  The owners would like to finance the purchase of another home, and are willing to pay 5% interest on the equity they have been able to save up.\
